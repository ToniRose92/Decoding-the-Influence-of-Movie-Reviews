# Decoding the Influence of Movie Reviews

## Project Overview
This project explores how the sentiment and content of movie reviews influence the future success of actors and directors. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques, I analyzed public reviews to determine how mentions of actors and directors affect their future projectsâ€™ box office performance and audience reception.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLP libraries
- **Data Sources**: Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDb
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Extracted review data from multiple sources and performed thorough data cleaning.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Used NLP techniques to classify the sentiment of reviews.
3. **Impact Analysis**: Assessed the relationship between review sentiment and box office success.

## Key Findings
- Positive sentiment in reviews significantly correlates with an increase in box office revenue for directors.
- Neutral sentiment had a surprisingly positive impact on actors' revenue.
- Further analysis showed that certain genres were more influenced by reviews than others.
